# PModel

The P model can be used to calculate gross primary production (GPP) at site or global scale. Basic inputs include temperature, CO2 concentration, short wave radiation, vapour pressure, fAPAR, precipitation. Grided data at 0.5 * 0.5 degree is required to run global GPP but could be modified accordingly.
